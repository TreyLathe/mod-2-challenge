COMMENTS:
Work done to fit the acceptance criteria:

WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

**All these are included. 

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

<!-- **Navigation links in header take viewer to cooresponding section -->

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

<!-- **Titled images are currently place holders, need to be replaced with original or royaltyfree if not . -->

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

<!-- **The first application uses a larger (full screen width) box with larger image -->

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

<!-- **Currently, first application links to Password Generator created later. ) -->

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

<!-- ** size initially designed for phone screens, with media screen change for larger screens. Need further changes to have it fit better in mobile devices. CUrrently not working as hoped.  -->
